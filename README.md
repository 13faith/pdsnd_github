**BikeShare Data**
Over the last ten years, bike-sharing systems have become more popular in cities worldwide. These services let users rent bikes for short periods, often at a norminal fee. You can pick up a bike from one spot and drop it off at another, or you can return it to where you got it. Each bike can be used by multiple people in a single day.

Thanks to technology, it's now easy for users to find and use these bike-sharing stations. Plus, these technologies provide lots of data that can help us understand how people use these systems.

In this project, i will use data from Motivate, a company that operates bike-sharing systems in major U.S. cities, to explore how people use these systems in three big cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

**Datasets**
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

**Statistics Computed**
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, the codes provided the following information:

1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day
2 Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
3 Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time
4 User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
Earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

**Files**
The three city dataset files used:
